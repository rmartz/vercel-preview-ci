# The OKF documentation format

Everything under `docs/` follows Google's **Open Knowledge Format (OKF)** — a
convention for knowledge pages that are equally legible to humans and to agents: a
markdown file whose body is prose and whose leading YAML frontmatter carries
structured metadata, with pages linked to one another by ordinary markdown links.
The frontmatter is what lets an agent filter and rank pages by `type` / `tags` and
traverse the link graph without a translation layer.

> **Authoritative reference.** This page describes how we _apply_ OKF here. For
> any question about the format itself — field semantics, new field families,
> edge cases — defer to the upstream specification, which is the single source of
> truth:

> We target **OKF v0.2**. Where this page and the spec disagree, the spec wins;
> open a PR to correct this page.

## Content pages

Every page that documents a piece of this repo carries frontmatter delimited by
`---` fences at the very top of the file:

```yaml
---
type: Reference # required
title: What vercel-preview-ci is # required here
description: One specific sentence — the search surface an agent matches on. # required here
resource: .github/workflows/vercel-preview.yml # required for every non-Design, non-Reference type
tags: [vercel, ci] # optional
---
```

This repo runs the **code-documentation flavour** of the `okf` check, so it is
stricter than the open OKF spec in two ways:

- **`type`** is required and constrained to a curated vocabulary — **`Skill`**,
  **`Script`**, **`Library`**, **`Design`**, plus **`Reference`** for concept /
  guide pages like this one.
- **`resource`** — a repo-relative path that must **exist on disk** — is
  **required on every non-`Design`, non-`Reference` page**. `Design` and
  `Reference` pages are exempt. The current pages are `Reference` pages
  (concepts and how-tos) plus one `Design` page (recorded decisions).

The curated `type` vocabulary and resource-exempt types are configured in
[`.repo-hygiene.yml`](../.repo-hygiene.yml) under `checks.okf`.

## Index pages

Each directory carries an **`index.md`** that links its content pages. Per the
spec, `index.md` files carry **no frontmatter**, with one exception: the
bundle-root [`docs/index.md`](index.md) may carry a single `okf_version` key. The
tree must be fully navigable — every content page reachable by following links
from `docs/index.md`. Both conventions are enforced by the `okf-index` check.

## Enforcement

Conformance is gated by this repo's **Repo Hygiene** workflow, which runs the
`okf` (frontmatter) and `okf-index` (navigability) checks from
[`@rmartz/repo-hygiene`](https://github.com/rmartz/repo-hygiene) against `docs/`.
Run the same checks locally against a built or installed CLI:

```bash
repo-hygiene okf okf-index --check --config .repo-hygiene.yml
```
